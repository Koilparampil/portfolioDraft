        <h3> Hello, My name is Chris Koilparampil. I am a recent Graduate of Manhattan College. 
        I have a Bachelors Degree in Electrical Engineering with a Concentration in Applied Mathematics. 
        I am currently enrolled in Columbia's Coding bootcamp in hopes of switching my sights onto something closer to the field of 
        Full-Stack Engineering. </h3>
        <br>
    <h3>In my free time I like to undertake different projects. My most recent project that was to build a fully working electric skateboard. Another 
        personal project I had undertook was restoring a dead Server that was in use for over a decade. </h3>
